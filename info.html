        <h3>General Information</h3>
        <h4>Geography and Demographics</h4>
        <p>
          Kagawa Prefecture (香川県) is located on the northeast portion on the
          island of Shikoku. Kagawa Prefecture has a population of 949,358
          people. It is the smallest prefecture by geographic area at 1,877
          square kilometers. Kagawa Prefecture's neighbors are Ehime Prefecture
          (愛媛県) to the southwest and Tokushima Prefecture (徳島県) to the
          south. To the north lies the Seto Inland Sea. Beyond that lies Okayama
          Prefecture (岡山県). Okayama Prefecture and Kagawa Prefecture are
          connected by the Great Seto Bridge. Kagawa Prefecture's capital is
          Takamatsu, which also happens to be the largest city of the
          prefecture.
        </p>
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>
          Before the modern prefectures was established, Kagawa Prefecture was
          known as Sanuki Province. During the Meiji Era, specifically in August
          of 1876, Kagawa was made a part of Ehime Prefecture. In December of
          1888, Kagawa regained its independent prefecture status.
        </p>
        <h4>Food</h4>
        <p>
          Kagawa is famous for many foods! The most famous of them all is the
          Sanuki Udon, a style of thick wheat noodles that became a cultural
          identity for the area. Kagawa is also famous for "hone-tsuki-dori",
          seasoned chicken thighs cooked on the bone. The dish originated in
          Marugame City, here in Kagawa! Now it has become a popular dish across
          izakayas in Japan! Other staples include olive products, such as olive
          beef and olive yellowtail, and delectable sweets made from locally
          produced wasanbon sugar.
        </p>
        <h4>Transportation</h4>
        <p>
          Kagawa Prefecture is well-connected by both land and sea. One of the
          most impressive landmarks in Kagawa, the Great Seto Bridge, links
          Kagawa to Okayama Prefecture on Honshu. The bridge serves both cars
          and trains, making it an essential route for travel and commerce.
          Within the prefecture, the JR Shikoku rail lines and various local
          trains provide easy access to cities and towns. Ferries connect
          Takamatsu and other coastal cities to nearby islands like Naoshima and
          Shōdoshima, making it easy to explore the Seto Inland Sea. Takamatsu
          Airport offers domestic flights to major cities like Tokyo and
          Okinawa, and also a few international flights to destinations such as
          Seoul and Shanghai.
        </p>
