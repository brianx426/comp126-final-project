# COMP126 Final Project

## The story behind this project
In my Japanese class that I took a few semesters ago, I had to research a prefecture of Japan. I decided to do something with that information and turn it into a tourism website for this final project. 

All images were found on Google, and I did get some help from W3Schools in creating the image galleries.
